# React-Typescript Boilerplate

> For those who are tired of paying the cost of installing packages they will NEVER EVER use.

This repository provides a starting point for SPA projects using the following stack:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with some recommended configs.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

## Some Notes

- The source root (i.e., `src/`) can be referenced using the `@/` prefix.
- The build result goes into the `dist/` directory.

## TODOs

- Keep track of the version upgrades of dependencies.
- Fine-tune `eslint.config.mjs` and `tsconfig.json` properly (RTFM!).
- and more..
